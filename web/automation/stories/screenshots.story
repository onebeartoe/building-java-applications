As a Web automation developer,
I need a method to take screenshots of the current page under test,
so that I can view what the application screen looks like at any point in the test.

Acceptance Criteria

The screenshot method is called at the test class level and
the screenshot is saved to the filesystem and
a post process hook exists to automatically screenshot at the end of each test and
.
