User Story: Light Strip for Build Stati

As a developer, I would like a to have LED indicators for project build stati, so that I have an 
idea of the build heath just by looking over at the extreme notification center.

Condition of Acceptance

An app is available to periodically check the RSS feeds of the builds and 
the app communicates with the Arduino to update the LED strip status and 
the LED strip indicates the build status with the corresponding color.
